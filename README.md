# Covid-Sewage-Search

This repository contains the codes used in the paper "Mathematical Methods for Searching on Trees Under Network Uncertainty: A Case Study forVirus Detection on Sewage Networks". The authors of this paper are I. S. Beaudry, J. Baboun, L. M. Castro, A. Jara, B. Rubio, and J. Verschae.

## Files description

- The file simulate_new.py performs the search simulation over the San Pedro de la Paz graph.
- The file simulate_random.py performs the search simulation over randomly generated DAGs.
- The data folder contains the data of both the San Pedro graph, and the network that generates the random graphs.
